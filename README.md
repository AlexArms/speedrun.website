The dream: src 2.0

The MVP (minimum viable product):
LTTP Leaderboards (starting with this because its an okay sized game with complex categories, and a db that we already have (or at least I think pinkus has it)
User Profiles
Run Uploads (or external linking)
Board Customization and good management tools.
